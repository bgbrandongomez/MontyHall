<h3 id="why-i-made-it">Why I Made It</h3>

<p>I made this guessing game because I was finding something to do after finishing an assignment for one of my classes. Since I did not have a compiler on hand and did not work on it enough to warrant using Wercker to compile it, I just wrote the code completely from memory and left all bugs in it. It was just a quick project, but it is a fun one anyway, and it still is a fun game to play, even though it was just a quick project.</p>
