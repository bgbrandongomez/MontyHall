<h3><a id="stable-releases" class="anchor" href="#stable-releases" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Stable Releases</h3>

<p>There are no releases because this was a fun and simple project and I never intend to modify the code again. For that very reason I never bothered to make a release. However, I did leave a .class file of the simulator located at <a href="https://github.com/{{ page.developer }}/{{ page.projectid }}/raw/{{ page.branch }}/MontyHall.class">https://github.com/{{ page.developer }}/{{ page.projectid }}/raw/{{ page.branch }}/MontyHall.class</a>.</p>
