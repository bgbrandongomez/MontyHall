This can be paired with an existing virtual reality set to produce the realistic images or can be viewed from the phone app using Augmented Reality if the person does not own a virtual reality kit.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ol>\r\n      </section>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    \r\n  </body>\r\n</html>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
